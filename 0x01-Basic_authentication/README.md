# Base64 Encoding and Basic Authentication
What is Base64?
Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. It is commonly used to transmit data that needs to be stored or transferred in an environment that only allows certain ASCII characters.

How to Encode a String in Base64
You can encode a string in Base64 using the following steps:

Convert the string to bytes:

message = "Hello, World!"
message_bytes = message.encode('ascii')
Encode the bytes to a Base64 string:

import base64
base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(message_bytes)
base64_message = base64_bytes.decode('ascii')
The resulting base64_message will be the Base64 encoded version of the original string.

# What is Basic Authentication?
Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It involves sending a username and password in the Authorization header of an HTTP request. The username and password are combined and encoded in Base64 before being sent.

How to Send the Authorization Header
To send the Authorization header with Basic authentication, follow these steps:

Combine the username and password with a colon:

username = "myusername"
password = "mypassword"
credentials = f"{username}:{password}"
Encode the credentials in Base64:

import base64
credentials_b64 = base64.b64encode(credentials.encode('ascii')).decode('ascii')
Add the Authorization header to your HTTP request:

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Basic {credentials_b64}'
}
Now, you can use these headers in your HTTP requests to authenticate with a server using Basic authentication.
